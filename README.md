Steganography Project : 
-A data hiding project that the user uses in order to hide his data in other data forms that can not be discovered
 by others unless they have the decryption code/programme/key/etc..
In the project the user can hide images or text in other images.
the user inputs the image he wants to hide his data in and then inputs the data to be used to hide (image/text). 
data are stored through bit masking/manipulation process in which bits of the storing image is changed by the (text/image) data bits.
